    /*
     * Summarizing from http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/learn_datum.html:
     * Like GPS, OpenStreetMap uses the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system, 
     * and altitudes in OSM are measured relative to the WGS84 datum. On the other hand, USGS 
     * elevation data from the National Elevation Dataset (NED, http://ned.usgs.gov/) are 
     * referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
     * The NAVD88 datum used by NED is an "orthometric" datum based on mean sea level in one 
     * particular part of the world; the so-called 3D datums used in GPS and OSM are ellipsoids 
     * intended to cover the whole Earth. Orthometric datums like NAVD 88 are equipotential 
     * (gravitational) surfaces of the Earth (geoids [1]) which include the effects of topography 
     * because the Earth's mass is irregularly distributed. Ellipsoid datums like NAD83 are smooth 
     * geometric approximations of the earthâ€™s surface (ellipsoids) without topography. 
     * Differences between the two are significant (up to 100 meters).
     * 
     * Current geoid models relate NAD83 ellipsoid heights to NAVD88 orthometric heights, i.e. 
     * the geoid for the continental United States is calibrated against and defined relative to 
     * the GPS ellipsoid. 
     * 
     * According to http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=561, "it is generally assumed 
     * that WGS 84 (original) is identical to NAD 83 (1986)." 
     * According to http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/learn_datum.html "there is a 2 meter 
     * difference between two of the most frequently used 3-D datums, the North American Datum of 
     * 1983 (NAD 83) and the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 84)." 
     * 
     * In OTP we convert between these two systems using one of these geoids defined relative 
     * to an ellipsoid. The rasters describing the datum are not included in OTP by default because 
     * they double the size of the OTP distribution, but are only needed by people loading 
     * elevations in North America. 
     * 
     * In OTP we perform the conversion using a geoid defined relative to the NAD83 ellipsoid. 
     * This is backed up by an NOAA publication at 
     * http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc95-19408.pdf stating they are for all 
     * practical purposes identical, especially when using handheld equipment. NAD 83 and WGS 84 
     * ellipsoid equivalence is also explained in a post at 
     * http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=97337.
     * 
     * The datum rasters must be downloaded from the OTP website and placed in the NED cache directory.
     * TODO they could be fetched automatically from a static URL on the opentripplanner website.
