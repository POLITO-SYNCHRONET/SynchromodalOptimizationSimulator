/**
 * A class that determines when one search branch prunes another at the same Vertex, and ultimately which solutions
 * are retained. In the general case, one branch does not necessarily win out over the other, i.e. multiple states can
 * coexist at a single Vertex.
 * 
 * Even functions where one state always wins (least weight, fastest travel time) are applied within a multi-state
 * shortest path tree because bike rental, car or bike parking, and turn restrictions all require multiple incomparable 
 * states at the same vertex. These need the graph to be "replicated" into separate layers, which is achieved by 
 * applying the main dominance logic (lowest weight, lowest cost, Pareto) conditionally, only when the two states
 * have identical bike/car/turn direction status.
 * 
 * Dominance functions are serializable so that routing requests may passed between machines in different JVMs, for instance
 * in OTPA Cluster.
