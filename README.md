<b>SYNCHRO-NET</b>

SYNCHRO-NET, SYNCHRO-modal supply chain eco-NET (http://www.synchronet.eu/), is a Horizon2020
European research project that aims to overcome the stress due to increasing transportation distances, higher
complexity, and vulnerability of supply chains, mainly fostered by the modern-age e-commerce facilities and
globalization.

The optimization simulator is an open source system for strategic freight logistics planning developed within the SYNCHRO-NET project. It provides strategic-level decision support regarding routes and schedules for synchro-modal freight transportation. As an extension to the open source platform called OpenTripPlanner(OTP)(http://opentripplanner.org), the simulator inherits a set of REST API for journey planning as well as a map-based Javascript client. However, in SYNCHRO-NET project, the OTP has been extensively customized to be used as a synchro-modal multi-agency container-based freight transportation planner. New features are introduced: multiple transportation modes, multi-attribute optimization, advanced searching options, outputs and post-optimization functionalities, user configurations, risk analysis, advanced simulation modalities(multi-destination search, multi-container management). 

Additional information and instructions are available in the 'Guide' folder, including a installation guide.
